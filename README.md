# NYT Article Scraper

## What is the “NYT Article Scraper” ?

"NYT Article Scraper" is a MongoDB, Express.js, Node,js, Handlebars, and Cheerio-based webapp that allows users to search for articles on the NY Times and load them in a seperate interface. This was primarily a test for myself to improve my skills with Web Scraping, MongoDB, and full-stack applications in general.

## Functionality/Usage

1. Upon loading, the site will generate a list of NYT articles.
2. The user can choose to save these articles or click their headlines to view them on the NYT website. 
3. If the user clicks on the "saved articles" tab, they can view all the previously saved articles, or delete them.
